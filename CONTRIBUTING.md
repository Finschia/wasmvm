## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to follow [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Commit message and Pull Request message

- Follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to release note automation.
- Don't mention or link that can't accessable from public.
- Use English only. Because this project will be published to the world-wide open-source world. But no worries. We are fully aware of that most of us are not the English-native.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the [README.md](README.md) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Fill out all sections of the pull request template. That makes it easier to review your PR for the reviewers.
4. You may merge the pull request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Pull Merge Process

1. Ensure target branch is `main`.
2. Ensure pull branch is up to date to the target branch.
3. Run `make test` to ensure that all tests pass.
4. Ensure all conversations are resolved before merging.
5. Merge pull request with proper merge strategy (usually `squash merging`).

### Release Process

1. Update the version using the script (`devtools/set_version.sh`).
2. Update the changelog using the script (`devtools/update_changelog.sh`).
   - the script generates and appends new logs to `CHANGELOG.md` using [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog).
3. Review the changelogs generated by scripts.
4. Make a release PR with a proper target branch.
   - The PR comment becomes the body of the release note.
5. Do PR review and merge.
6. After merging it, CI will detect version changes.
   - _comparing with a previously released version using cargo command (`cargo tree -i wasmvm`)_
7. CI will create a new version tag and publish artifacts with release notes.
