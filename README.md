This repository is forked from [CosmWasm/wasmvm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm)

This is a wrapper around the [CosmWasm VM](https://github.com/line/cosmwasm/tree/master/packages/vm).

It allows you to compile, initialize and execute CosmWasm smart contracts
from Go applications, in particular from [x/wasm](https://github.com/line/lbm-sdk/tree/v2/develop/x/wasm).

For more detail, see the [original document](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm#readme)
